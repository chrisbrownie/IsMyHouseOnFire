# IsMyHouseOnFire
This is a very simple PHP script designed to be hosted somewhere that checks to see if your house is burning down or not. If your house is burning down*, it will tell you so.






* Because people are stupid, it's probably worth clarifying that this only tells you if a URL is working or not. It does not check to see if your house is burning down.
